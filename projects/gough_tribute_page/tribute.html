                    <p>The Dutch born Post-Impressionist painter is one of the most famous and influential figures in
                        Western art. However his influence on the art world today does not reflect that of it in his own
                        lifetime as he was not well known or commercially sucessful. In his time Vincent Van Gogh
                        created around 2,100 different artworks nearly 860 of them oil paintings and the majority of
                        these were produced within the last 2 years of his life.</p>
                    <p>His initial works, for the most part still lifes and portrayals of workers, containing not many
                        indications of the distinctive variety that recognized his later work. In 1886, he moved to
                        Paris where he met individuals from the avante-garde, including Émile Bernard and Paul Gauguin,
                        who were responding against the Impressionist reasonableness. As his work developed he made
                        another way to deal with still life and scene. His works of art became more brilliant as he
                        fostered a style that turned out to be completely acknowledged during his visit in Arles in the
                        South of France in 1888. During this period he expanded his topic to incorporate series of olive
                        trees, wheat fields and sunflowers.</p>
                    <p>Van Gogh experienced maniacal episodes, hallucinations and, however he stressed over his
                        psychological steadiness, frequently ignored his actual wellbeing, didn't eat as expected and
                        drank vigorously. His kinship with Gauguin finished after a showdown between the two when, in a
                        fury, Van Gogh cut off a piece of his very own left ear with a razor. Later, he invested energy
                        in mental medical clinics. When he released himself and moved to the Auberge Ravoux in
                        Auvers-sur-Oise close to Paris, he went under the consideration of the homeopathic specialist
                        Paul Gachet. His downturn endured and on 27 July 1890, Van Gogh is accepted to have shot himself
                        in the chest with a gun, passing on from his wounds two days after the fact.</p>
                    <p>Van Gogh's compositions didn't sell during his lifetime, during which he was by and large thought
                        to be a maniac and a disappointment, albeit a few gatherers perceived the worth of his work. His
                        notoriety came solely after his demise, when he developed in the public creative mind into a
                        misconstrued genius.[6] His standing filled in the mid twentieth 100 years as components of his
                        style came to be consolidated by the Fauves and German Expressionists. He accomplished broad
                        basic and business accomplishment throughout the following many years, and is recognized as a
                        significant however shocking painter whose upset character exemplifies the heartfelt ideal of
                        the tormented craftsman.</p>

                    <p>Today, Van Gogh's works are among the world's most costly compositions to have at any point sold,
                        and his heritage is regarded by an exhibition hall in his name, the Van Gogh Gallery in
                        Amsterdam, which holds the world's biggest assortment of his canvases and drawings.</p>
